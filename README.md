<h3>Docker Applications </h3>
<ul>
  <li>External Connection</li>
  <p>Consumption of a web API by a container</p>
  
  <li>Host Connection</li>
  <p>The connection between the service running in the Docker environment and the host, which in this case is my computer running a database service, is crucial for the  proper functioning of the application. This connection allows the Docker service to access the database and other resources on the host, such as files and network interfaces. It is important to ensure that the connection is properly configured to ensure that the application operates efficiently and without interruptions</p>
  <li>Container Connection</li>
  <p>The connection between two containers running database services and an API controller is essential for communication between them. Through this connection, the database services can store and retrieve data, and the API controller can access this data and provide it to other components of the application</p>
</ul>
